# -Multilevel-feedback-queue-scheduler-
I applied the Multilevel-Feedback-Queue Scheduler concept by using Java.

At first, the user will enter the number of processes, the arrival
time and the burst time for each process. the process will be sorted
according to their arrival time in the linked list, and then the
the process will enter the multilevel-feedback-queues scheduler and
calculate each of the waiting times, turnaround times, remaining
time, response time and throughput time and displayed them on the
screen as their status after and before entering each queue. In the
end, the throughput and average waiting time will be calculated
and shown to the user.
